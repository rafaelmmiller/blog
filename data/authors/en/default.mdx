I'm **Rafael Miller**, a Brazilian physicist who embraced tech development in startups for **over a decade** now.

Generalist, I've been involved in a diverse range of projects, from **full-stack development** to **data science**, and from **B2B marketplaces** to **high-scale B2C apps**. Recently exploring **generative AI** and its applications.

Coffee 5x / day, brewing beer on weekends, and living in the mountains of **Minas**.

The start of a new year is when many of us write down ambitious goals (most of which we probably won't achieve—let's be honest!) and try to form new habits. We’re no different. This year, we’ve started a workout routine, aiming to hit the [150-minute weekly mark of high-intensity cardio](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6536904/). But above all, our focus this year is on our children and the adoption process.

## Who Is "I"?
Let me introduce myself: I’m Rafael Miller, 31 years, 7 months, and 25 days old. I live in the serene mountains of Minas Gerais, Brazil, where every morning starts with coffee and weekends often feature beer—whether drinking it or brewing it. I’m a physicist and developer, programming nearly every weekday for over a decade now. Currently, I’m working at my first international job at [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev), where I help build and scale a powerful scraping platform.

## Who Is "We"?
When I say "we" in this blog, it’s not just a rhetorical flourish. It includes my companion, passion, lover, and comrade, Dani Luz. Dani is my partner in everything—from life to this new chapter of parenthood we’re embarking on together. While she may or may not introduce herself on the blog, her presence is woven into all that I do.

## Why the Blog?
To complement these goals and habits, I’m committing to writing at least one article per week. This blog will be my "review" moment—a time to reflect on the week and jot down a few thoughts about what I accomplished.

## Topics Within This Blog
This will be a personal blog covering a wide variety of topics based on my interests. For instance, I’m considering writing about neovim and the programming setup I’m using for this blog, as well as sharing insights from Positive Discipline, the educational book I’m currently reading. I’ll also dive into topics like brewing beer—both the successes and the occasional "learning experiences"—and maybe even share some reflections on life here in Minas Gerais.

And of course, I plan to document the journey of adoption, capturing the emotions, challenges, and milestones that come with becoming a parent.

What are your goals for this year? Are you starting a blog or trying something new too? Let me know!
